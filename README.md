Yusong:

Implementing a maze game where we have an avatar and some random enemies. The avatar will be placed in a specific point of entrance in the maze (not randomly). Avatar can collect things that adds additional functionality to the avatar, such as becoming invisible or more resistant to enemiesâ€™ attack, or even the ability to cross the maze wall, and the ideas mentioned above. At the same time, the enemies are generated randomly to be placed on different spots of the maze after the game starts. Then the enemies should walk inside the maze (Randomly or with specified path). 

Final Design to specify:
1. The Background Story of Game.
2. How NPC move around.
