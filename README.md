Game development with professor Nace.

Implementing a maze game where we have an avatar and some random enemies. The initial maze is generated by one of the maze algorithms. The avatar will be placed in a specific point of entrance in the maze (not randomly). Then the goal of the avatar was to find its way out and avoid enemies. Avatar can collect things that adds additional functionality to the avatar, such as becoming invisible or more resistant to enemiesâ€™ attack, or even the ability to cross the maze wall, etc. At the same time, the enemies are generated randomly to be placed on different spots of the maze after the game starts. Then the enemies should walk inside the maze also randomly, this would mean that the enemy would have equal probability of going into any direction at a given turn in maze. When the enemies are inside a straight line of maze routes, they just walk until some crossing/turn occurs.
